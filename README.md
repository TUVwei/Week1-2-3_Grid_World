# Week1-2-3_Grid_World
Here is the code for week 1 to week 3 Grid World problem.

# Read me
We write codes to plooting maps/trajectories/valurs/actions and solving VI, PI in HW1_2.

We write a code in HW3 use function approximator to approximate n agents system. It has great flexibility: you can change number of agents, maps, rewards, your features, probability of what percent of states and next states to be counted. And the code can be changed to VI with several modification. However, we are not sure it is 100\% correct since the convergence performance is not good.

A detail description and our working detail is shown in the PDF file.

Work done by Chengzhi Wei and Wenyi Wang.
