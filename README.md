# Week1-2-3_Grid_World
Here is the code for week 1 to week 3 Grid World problem.

# Usage
Install python 3.8 and jupyter notebook.

Run the first row to install the dependency

Change the second row of code to change the shape of the gird word and reward positions.

Run the code by order.

We write codes to plooting maps/trajectories/valurs/actions and solving VI, PI in HW1_2. Details of the function description are in the code file and some working details are shown in readme.pdf.

We write a code in HW3 use function approximator to approximate n agents system. It has great flexibility: you can change number of agents, maps, rewards, your features, probability of what percent of states and next states to be counted. And the code can be changed to VI with several modification. However, we are not sure it is 100\% correct since the convergence performance is not good.

A detail description and our working detail is shown in the PDF file.

Work done by Chengzhi Wei and Wenyi Wang.
